# members-only

## About
This web app is a message board where members can write and view messages other members have written.
However, the authors of messages are visible only to user who are also members. To become a member, users must navigate to a specific portion of the website and answer a riddle to become a member.

## Stack
This project was built using Express, MongoDB and the Pug templating engine.

## What I learned
This project taught me how to apply user authentication within my apps. For this project, I used PassportJS to handle user authentication and bcryptJS to secure passwords.
